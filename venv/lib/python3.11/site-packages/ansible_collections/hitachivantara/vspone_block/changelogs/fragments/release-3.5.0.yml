bugfixes:
- Fixed output details of `host_group_number` and `host_group_id` in `hv_hg` and 'hv_hg_facts' modules to be consistent.

minor_changes:
- "Added new module `hv_mp_facts` to retrieve MP Blades information from VSP storage models."
- "Added new module `hv_external_parity_group_facts` to retrieve information about External Parity Group."
- "Added new module `hv_external_path_group` to manage External Path Groups."
- "Added new module `hv_external_path_group_facts` to retrieve information about External Path Group."
- Added the following new parameters to the output of hv_ldev_facts is_compression_acceleration_enabled, data_reduction_process_mode, is_relocation_enabled, is_full_allocation_enabled
- Added the ability to format a volume to the hv_ldev module.
- Added the ability to change the settings of the following parameters of an LDEV using the hv_ldev module - data_reduction_process_mode, is_compression_acceleration_enabled, is_relocation_enabled,is_full_allocation_enabled, is_alua_enabled
- Added the following parameters to creating an LDEV using the hv_ldev module is_parallel_execution_enabled, start_ldev_id, end_ldev_id, external_parity_group, is_compression_acceleration_enabled
- Added the ability to set the nick_name of an iSCSI using the hv_iscsi_target module.
- Enabled the iSCSI target name together with the port ID as identifiers for the iSCSI target.if both ID and name are specified, the ID is used together with the port ID as the iSCSI target identifier.
