  module: web_app_pool
  short_description: Configure IIS Web Application Pools
  description:
    - Creates, removes and configures an IIS Web Application Pool.
  requirements:
    - IISAdministration PowerShell module
  options:
    attributes:
      description:
        - This field is a free form dictionary value for the application pool attributes.
        - These attributes are based on the naming standard at
          U(https://www.iis.net/configreference/system.applicationhost/applicationpools/add#005),
          see the examples section for more details on how to set this.
        - You can also set the attributes of child elements like cpu and processModel, see the examples
          to see how it is done.
        - While you can use the numeric values for enums it is recommended to use
          the enum name itself, e.g., use SpecificUser instead of 3 for processModel.identityType.
        - managedPipelineMode may be either "Integrated" or "Classic".
        - startMode may be either "OnDemand" or "AlwaysRunning".
        - Use O(state) to modify the state of the app pool.
        - When trying to set C(processModel.password) and you receive a 'Value does fall within the
          expected range' error, you have a corrupted keystore. Please follow
          U(http://structuredsight.com/2014/10/26/im-out-of-range-youre-out-of-range/) to help fix your host.

      description:
        - The state of the application pool.
        - If V(absent) will ensure the app pool is removed.
        - If V(present) will ensure the app pool is configured and exists.
        - If V(restarted) will ensure the app pool exists and will restart, this is never idempotent.
        - If V(started) will ensure the app pool exists and is started.
        - If V(stopped) will ensure the app pool exists and is stopped.
