# Vars file is relative to playbook file
# Sequence:
# 1. Common variables
# 2. encrypted vault file
# 3. environment specific variables
# 4. all_vars which reference the preceding three files.
# common_ prefixes common variables
# vault_env_ prefixes encrypted variables
# env_ prefixes environment specific variables
# all_var incorporates preceding variables and defines variables without prefixes.
# use all_var variables in scripts.

# new base machines will be in appservers-base in /etc/ansible/hosts
